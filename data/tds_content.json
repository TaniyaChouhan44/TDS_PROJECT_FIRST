They’re perfect for small web tools that don’t need to run all the time. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\nYou can’t pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt\nYou can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\nYou can’t run commands (e.g. subprocess.run())\n\nVercel is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions.

    "title": "Prompt engineering",
    "content": "Prompt Engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\n\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\n\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\n\nAnthropic\nGoogle\nOpenAI\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\nUse prompt optimizers\n\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n\nAnthropic Prompt Optimizer\nOpenAI Prompt Generation\nGoogle AI-powered prompt writing tools\nBe clear, direct, and detailed\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\nBAD: Explain gravitation lensing. (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\nGOOD: Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\nWhen you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. For example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\n\nGive examples\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\nBAD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n\nGOOD: Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:\n\nTo tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…\nTo tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…\n\nNow, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\nGive examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\n\nThink step by step\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\nBAD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\nGOOD: Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step. (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\nAsk the model to think step by step. Don’t ask the model to just give the final answer right away. That’s like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head. Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves — like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb. For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\n\nAssign a role\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n\nBAD: Explain how to fix a software bug. (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\nGOOD: You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\nTell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\n\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\n\nUse XML to structure your prompt\n\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n\nBAD: Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\nGOOD:\n<instructions>\n  Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n</instructions>\n<example>\n  Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n</example>\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n(Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\nThink of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box. They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\n\nAnthropic | OpenAI | Google\n\nUse Markdown to format your output\n\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n\nBAD: Give me the steps in plain text. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\nGOOD: Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points. (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\nBAD: Correct the spelling and show the corrections. (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\nGOOD: Correct the spelling, showing <ins>additions</ins> and <del>deletions</del>. (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\nMarkdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand. You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points. These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\n\nUse JSON for machine-readable output\n\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\n\nBAD: Just list the items. (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n\nGOOD:\n\nOrganize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n```json\n[\n  { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n  { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n]\n```\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\n(Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\nNote: Always use JSON schema if possible. JSON schema is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n\nImagine you’re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile — it’s hard to find what you need later. JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes. Everything has its place: fields like ‘name,’ ‘description,’ and ‘value’ make the data easy to read, especially for machines. For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object. That way, when you hand it to a program, it’s all clear and ready to use.\n\nPrefer Yes/No answers\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\nBAD: On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\nGOOD: Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No. (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what’s being asked.)\n\nDon’t ask ‘On a scale of one to five…’. Models are not good with numbers. They don’t know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. ‘Yes or no?’ is simple. It’s clear. It’s quick. So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\n\nAsk for reason first, then the answer\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps before stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\nBAD: What is the best route to take? (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\nGOOD: First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\nBEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second. That way, the model won’t be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\n\nUse proper spelling and grammar\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\nBAD: xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser?? (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\nGOOD: Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation. (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\nIf your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly. When you do, the response will be much clearer.\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nWatch Prompt Engineering Tutorial – Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min).

It’s essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nIt takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n… using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4)\nThere’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and _ to avoid issues in URLs\nBase64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\nJSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\nEmail: MIME attachments encoding\nAuth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\nJWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\nSSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\nSAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\nGit: Encoding binary files in patches\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\nBase64 Decoder/Encoder for online encoding/decoding\ndata: URI Generator converts files to Data URIs\n Previous\nLLM Text Extraction\nNext \nVision Models",

    "content": "Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\n\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\nSearch. Find similar documents to a query.\nClassification. Classify text into categories.\nClustering. Group similar items into clusters.\nAnomaly Detection. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\nFeature\tLocal Models\tAPI\nPrivacy\tHigh\tDependent on provider\nCost\tHigh setup, low after that\tPay-as-you-go\nScale\tLimited by local resources\tEasily scales with demand\nQuality\tVaries by model\tTypically high\n\nThe Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\nRank. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\nMemory Usage. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\nEmbedding Dimensions. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\nMax Tokens. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a single input.\nLook for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\nLocal Embeddings\n\nHere’s a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nNote the get_similarity function.

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\n\nWhat Makes an Agent?\n\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n\nLLM Brain: Makes decisions about what to do next\nTools: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\nMemory: Retains context across multiple steps\n\nAgents operate through a loop:\n\nObserve the environment\nThink about what to do\nTake action using tools\nObserve results\nRepeat until task completion\nCommand-Line Agent Example\n\nWe’ve created a minimal command-line agent called llm-cmd-agent.py that:\n\nTakes a task description from the command line\nGenerates code to accomplish the task\nAutomatically extracts and executes the code\nPasses the results back to the LLM\nProvides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nThe agent will:\n\nGenerate a shell script to list files with their sizes\nExecute the script in a subprocess\nCapture the output (stdout and stderr)\nPass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\nPresent a final answer to the user\n\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n\nInitial prompt to generate a shell script\nCode extraction from the LLM response\nCode execution in a subprocess\nResult interpretation by the LLM\nError handling and retry logic if needed\n\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\n\nPlanning (generating code)\nExecution (running the code)\nReflection (interpreting results)\nAdaptation (fixing errors if needed)\nAgent Architectures\n\nDifferent agent architectures exist for different use cases:\n\nReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions\nReflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning\nMRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules\nPlan-and-Execute: Creates a plan first, then executes steps\nReal-World Applications\n\nLLM agents can be applied to various domains:\n\nResearch assistants that search, summarize, and synthesize information\nCoding assistants that write, debug, and explain code\nData analysis agents that clean, visualize, and interpret data\nCustomer service agents that handle queries and perform actions\nPersonal assistants that manage schedules, emails, and tasks\nProject Ideas\n\nHere are some practical agent projects you could build:\n\nStudy buddy agent: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts\nJob application assistant: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses\nPersonal finance agent: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities\nHealth and fitness coach: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation\nCourse project helper: Breaks down assignments, suggests resources, and reviews work\nBest Practices\nClear instructions: Define the agent’s capabilities and limitations\nEffective tool design: Create tools that are specific and reliable\nRobust error handling: Agents should recover gracefully from failures\nMemory management: Balance context retention with token efficiency\nUser feedback: Allow users to correct or guide the agent\nLimitations and Challenges\n\nCurrent LLM agents face several challenges:\n\nHallucination: Agents may generate false information or tool calls\nPlanning limitations: Complex tasks require better planning capabilities\nTool integration complexity: Each new tool adds implementation overhead\nContext window constraints: Limited memory for long-running tasks\nSecurity concerns: Tool access requires careful permission management\n Previous\nFunction Calling\nNext \nLLM Image Generation",

    "content": "Converting PDFs to Markdown\n\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nUse Cases:\n\nLLM training and fine-tuning: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\nKnowledge base creation: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\nContent repurposing: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\nData extraction: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\nAccessibility: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\nCitation and reference management: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\nDocumentation conversion: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\nPyMuPDF4LLM\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It’s specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses MuPDF as its PDF parsing engine. PyMuPDF is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\nuv run --with pymupdf4llm: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\npython -c '...': Executes Python code directly from the command line\nimport pymupdf4llm: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\nh = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"): Creates a file to write the markdown output\nh.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\")): Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\nMarkitdown\n\nMarkitdown is Microsoft’s tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It’s a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPYTHONUTF8=1: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\nuvx markitdown: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n$FILE.pdf: The input PDF file\n> markitdown.md: Redirects output to a markdown file\nUnstructured\n\nUnstructured is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\nGROBID\n\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR’ed ones, GROBID remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nMistral OCR API\n\nMistral OCR offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\nAzure Document Intelligence API\n\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, Azure Document Intelligence provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID’s reference extraction capabilities.\n\nOther libraries\n\nDocling is IBM’s document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\n\nMegaParse takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\n\nComparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\nTool\tStrengths\tWeaknesses\tBest For\nPyMuPDF4LLM\tStructure preservation, LLM optimization\tRequires PyTorch\tAI training data, semantic structure\nMarkitdown\tMulti-format support, simple usage\tLess precise layout handling\tBatch processing, mixed documents\nUnstructured\tWide format support, active development\tCan be resource-intensive\tProduction pipelines, integration\nGROBID\tReference extraction excellence\tNarrower use case\tAcademic papers, citations\nDocling\tAdvanced document understanding\tInstallation difficulties\tResearch applications\nMegaParse\tComprehensive approach\tRequires OpenAI API\tComplex documents, OCR needs\n\nHow to pick:\n\nNeed LLM-ready content?

    "title": "Convert HTML to Markdown",
    "content": "Converting HTML to Markdown\n\nWhen working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:\n\nContent analysis: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\nData mining: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\nOffline reading: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\nContent migration: Move content between different CMS platforms\nSEO analysis: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\nArchive creation: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\nAccessibility: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\n\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line.\n\ndefuddle-cli\n\ndefuddle-cli specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\n\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nfind . -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found\nnpx --package defuddle-cli -y: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\ndefuddle parse {} --md: Parses the HTML file (represented by {}) and converts to markdown\n-o {}.md: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\nPandoc\n\nPandoc is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\n\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\n\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nfind . -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec ... \\;: Executes the following command for each file found\npandoc: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n-f html -t markdown_strict: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n-o {}.md {}: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\nLynx\n\nLynx is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\n\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nfind . -type f -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\nfor f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch\nlynx -dump -nolist \"$f\": Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n-dump: Output the rendered page to stdout\n-nolist: Don’t include the list of links at the end\n> \"${f%.html}.txt\": Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\nw3m\n\nw3m is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.\n\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' \\\n  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ {} +\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nfind . -type f -name '*.html': Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\nfor f; do ... done: Loops through each file in the batch\nw3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\": Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML\n-dump: Output the rendered page to stdout\n-T text/html: Specify input format as HTML\n-cols 80: Set output width to 80 columns\n-no-graph: Don’t show graphic characters for tables and frames\n> \"${f%.html}.md\": Save output to a .md file with the same base name\nComparison\nApproach\tSpeed\tFormat Quality\tPreservation\tBest For\ndefuddle-cli\tSlow\tHigh\tGood structure and links\tContent migration, publishing\npandoc\tSlow\tVery High\tAlmost everything\tAcademic papers, documentation\nlynx\tFast\tLow\tBasic structure only\tQuick extraction, large batches\nw3m\tVery Slow\tMedium-Low\tBasic structure with better tables\tImproved readability over lynx\nOptimize Batch Processing\n\nProcess in parallel: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:\n\nfind . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nFilter files before processing:\n\nfind . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nCustomize output format with additional parameters:\n\n# For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting\nfind . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nHandle errors gracefully:\n\nfind . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nChoosing the Right Tool\nNeed speed with minimal formatting? Use the lynx approach\nNeed precise, complete conversion? Use pandoc\nNeed a balance of structure and cleanliness? Try defuddle-cli\nWorking with complex tables? w3m might render them better\n\nRemember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.\n\nCombined Crawling and Conversion\n\nSometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like Crawl4AI or markdown-crawler.\n\nFor research/data collection: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion\nFor simple website archiving: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution\nFor high-quality conversion: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion\nFor maximum speed: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline\nCrawl4AI\n\nCrawl4AI is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.\n\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install crawl4ai\ncrawl4ai-setup\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nuv venv: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)\nuv pip install crawl4ai: Installs the crawl4ai package\ncrawl4ai-setup: Initializes crawl4ai’s required dependencies\nmarkdown-crawler\n\nmarkdown-crawler combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It’s efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle.

This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.\n\nKey Concepts\nScheduling: Use cron syntax to run scrapers at specific times\nDependencies: Install required packages like httpx, lxml\nData Storage: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing\nRate Limiting: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests\n\nHere’s a sample scrape.py that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:\n\nimport json\nimport httpx\nfrom datetime import datetime, UTC\nfrom lxml import html\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\n\ndef scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"}\n    response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    tree = html.fromstring(response.text)\n    movies = []\n\n    for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"):\n        title = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")\n            else None\n        )\n        year = (\n            item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")\n            else None\n        )\n        rating = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")\n            else None\n        )\n\n        if title and year and rating:\n            movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating})\n\n    return movies\n\n\n# Scrape data and save with timestamp\nnow = datetime.now(UTC)\nwith open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f:\n    f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\")\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nHere’s a sample .github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml that runs the scraper daily and saves the data:\n\nname: Scrape IMDb Top 250\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day\n    - cron: \"0 0 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  scrape-imdb:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Install uv\n        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5\n\n      - name: Run scraper\n        run: | # python\n          uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py\n\n      - name: Commit and push changes\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add *.json\n          git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0\n          git push\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nBest Practices\nCache Dependencies: Use GitHub’s caching to speed up package installation\nHandle Errors: Implement retries and error logging\nRate Limiting: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers\nData Validation: Verify scraped data structure before saving\nMonitoring: Set up notifications for workflow failures\nTools and Resources\nhttpx: Async HTTP client\nGitHub Actions Marketplace\nGitHub Actions Documentation\nVideo Tutorials\n\n Previous\nWeb Automation with Playwright\nNext \nScraping emarketer.com",

(powers of 1000).\nBinary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.\n\nThe TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.\nFORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,\nthen FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.\nTIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.\nAlso the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.\n\nUsing color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and\nwith --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when\nstandard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment\nvariable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.\n\nExit status:\n 0  if OK,\n 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),\n 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).\n\nGNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\nFull documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>\nor available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n# By default, it just lists all file names\n!ls\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nsample_data  s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n# If we want to see the size of the file, use `-l` for the long-listing format\n!ls -l\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\ntotal 5672\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 root root    4096 Jun  6 14:21 sample_data\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 5801198 Jun  9 05:18 s-anand.net-Apr-2024.gz\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nUncompress the log file\n\ngzip is the most popular compression format on the web.

    "content": "Data Preparation in DuckDB\n\nDuckDB’s SQL engine can handle large files quickly. Below are common cleaning tasks using the DuckDB CLI.\n\nCreate a Sample Dataset\n\nLet’s create a sample dataset that mimics real business data patterns - incomplete customer records, time-series orders, and regional variations. Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques. This sample represents common e-commerce scenarios: missing customer info (20% of orders), seasonal patterns (15-day cycles), and geographic segmentation that drive business decisions like inventory placement and marketing campaigns.\n\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders AS\nSELECT\n  seq AS order_id,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 5 = 0 THEN NULL ELSE 'Customer ' || seq END AS customer,\n  date '2025-01-01' + CAST(seq % 15 AS INTEGER) AS order_date,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 3 = 0 THEN 'Widget ' || seq ELSE 'Gadget ' || seq END AS product,\n  round(random()*1000, 2) AS amount,\n  CASE WHEN seq % 4 = 0 THEN 'EU' ELSE 'US' END AS region\nFROM range(1, 50) tbl(seq);\nSQL\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nCreate a Messy CSV\n\nLet’s also simulate real-world data export issues - unescaped quotes, missing delimiters, and malformed records that break standard CSV parsers. Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn’t break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems.\n\ncat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv\norder_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer 3,2025-01-03,Gadget 3,300,EU\nEOF\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nCreate a Big CSV\n\nNext, we’ll create a large dataset to practice memory-efficient processing techniques that handle files too big to fit in RAM. When working with millions of customer records, transaction logs, or sensor data, traditional tools crash or run out of memory. DuckDB’s streaming capabilities let you process 100GB+ files on laptops by reading data in chunks, making big data analysis accessible without expensive infrastructure.\n\nduckdb sample.duckdb <<'SQL'\nCOPY (SELECT seq AS id, random() AS val FROM range(100000)) TO 'big.csv';\nSQL\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nExploratory Data Analysis\n\nWe need to examine our data structure and quality before making business decisions. Every data analysis starts with understanding what you have - missing values can skew customer segmentation, outliers affect revenue forecasting, and data types determine which analytical techniques work. Quick EDA prevents costly mistakes like launching marketing campaigns based on incomplete customer data or setting prices using corrupted transaction amounts.\n\n-- Preview and get stats\nSELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 5;\nDESCRIBE orders;\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(amount) AS avg_amount FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nConverting Data to Other Formats\n\nLet’s export cleaned data to formats optimized for different business needs. Analytics teams need Parquet for fast querying, APIs require JSON for web integration, and executives want CSV for Excel compatibility. Format conversion ensures your cleaned data reaches every stakeholder in their preferred format, enabling faster decision-making across departments without forcing everyone to learn SQL.\n\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.json' (FORMAT JSON);\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM orders) TO 'orders.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nReading Messy CSV\n\nWe need to handle corrupted files that would normally crash your data pipeline. Real-world CSV files from vendors, legacy systems, or manual exports often contain malformed rows that break standard parsers. Instead of spending hours manually fixing files or losing critical business data, DuckDB’s error handling lets you salvage usable records while identifying problem areas for follow-up with data providers.\n\n-- Skip bad lines while loading\nSELECT *\nFROM read_csv_auto('messy_orders.csv', ignore_errors=true);\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nHandling Missing Values\n\nIt’s important to address incomplete data that could lead to wrong business conclusions. Missing customer names prevent personalized marketing, absent transaction amounts skew revenue calculations, and incomplete addresses block shipping. Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process.\n\n-- Replace null customer names\nSELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nString Operations\n\nIt’s common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application.\n\nSELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nDate Parsing and Conversion\n\nTypically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting.\n\nSELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nConditional Logic and Binning\n\nA common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures. This segmentation forms the foundation for personalized pricing, customer targeting, and performance analysis.\n\nSELECT\n  order_id,\n  CASE WHEN amount > 700 THEN 'high' WHEN amount > 300 THEN 'medium' ELSE 'low' END AS price_band\nFROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nRegex Search and Replace\n\nWe often need to clean complex text patterns that simple string operations can’t handle. Product descriptions contain multiple spaces, phone numbers have inconsistent formatting, and addresses mix abbreviations with full words. Regular expressions fix these patterns systematically, ensuring consistent data quality for customer communications, shipping integrations, and search functionality.\n\nSELECT REGEXP_REPLACE(product, '\\\\s+', ' ', 'g') AS tidy_product FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nWorking with Multiple Formats\n\nLet’s combine data from different sources that use various file formats. Modern businesses receive data as CSV exports, JSON from APIs, and Parquet from data warehouses. Rather than maintaining separate processing pipelines, DuckDB’s format flexibility lets you join orders from your CSV exports with customer data from JSON APIs and inventory levels from Parquet files in a single query.\n\nCREATE TABLE json_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_json_auto('orders.json');\nCREATE TABLE parquet_orders AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('orders.parquet');\nSELECT * FROM orders UNION ALL SELECT * FROM parquet_orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nProcessing in Chunks\n\nWe handle massive datasets that exceed available memory by processing them in manageable segments. When analyzing years of transaction logs, customer behavior data, or sensor readings, loading everything at once crashes systems. Chunk processing enables analysis of terabyte-scale datasets on standard hardware, making enterprise-level data analysis accessible for fraud detection, customer lifetime value calculations, and operational analytics.\n\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 0;\nSELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('big.csv') LIMIT 1000 OFFSET 1000;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nFiltering Rows and Dropping Columns\n\nWe’ll focus analysis on relevant data subsets while removing sensitive or unnecessary information. Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets.\n\nSELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';\nSELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nDerived Columns\n\nNow, let’s create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators. Raw transaction amounts become profit margins with tax calculations, customer regions enable territory-based analysis, and dates support seasonal comparisons. These derived metrics power executive dashboards, sales team performance tracking, and automated business rules without requiring manual calculations or separate reporting tools.\n\nSELECT *, amount * 0.1 AS tax, UPPER(region) AS region_code FROM orders;\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nSummaries and Pivots\n\nA big part of data preparation is to transform detailed transaction data into executive-level insights that inform strategic decisions. Converting thousands of individual orders into regional sales summaries, customer segment performance, and product category trends enables quick identification of growth opportunities, underperforming markets, and inventory optimization needs. These aggregations become the foundation for board presentations, budget planning, and strategic initiatives.\n\n-- Aggregation\nSELECT region, COUNT(*) AS n_orders, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY region;\n\n-- Pivot by region\nSELECT *\nFROM orders\nPIVOT(COUNT(*) FOR region IN ('US', 'EU'));\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n\nUseful links:\n\nDuckDB Documentation\nSQL Functions\nDuckDB Extensions\n Previous\nData Preparation in the Editor\nNext \nCleaning Data with OpenRefine",

Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n\nTool\tExtract from JSON…\tWhy\njq\tJSON in the shell\tQuick data exploration and pipeline processing\nJMESPath\tJSON in Python\tHandle complex queries with a clean syntax\nijson\tJSON streams in Python\tParse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently\nPandas\tJSON columns in Python\tFast analysis of structured data\nSQL JSON\tJSON in databases\tCombine structured and semi-structured data\nDuckDB\tJSON anywhere\tFast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory\n\nExamples:\n\nUse Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\nLeverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\nApply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\nJSONPath Online Evaluator: Test JSON queries\njq play: Interactive jq query testing\nDuckDB JSON Tutorial: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\nCommand-line JSON Processing with jq\n\njq is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\nExample: Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nJMESPath Queries\n\nJMESPath offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It’s a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\nExample: Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nStreaming with ijson\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. ijson lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\nExample: Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return results\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nPandas JSON Columns\n\nPandas makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\nExample: Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nSQL JSON Functions\n\nSQL supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases. These are implemented by most popular databases, including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. This is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\nExample: An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\nDuckDB JSON Processing\n\nDuckDB shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\nExample: Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100\nCopy to clipboard\nError\nCopied\n Previous\nCleaning Data with OpenRefine\nNext \nData Transformation with dbt",
